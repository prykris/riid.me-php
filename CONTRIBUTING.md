## Pull Requests

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the README.md and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow SemVer. Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your main branch.
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful.

## Running Tests
